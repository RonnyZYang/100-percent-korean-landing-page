            Delicious and authentic Korean food!! Great prices for very generous
            portions. We tried the pork bone soup and the spicy pork belly rice
            dish and loved both!! You also get to choose your side dishes. The
            owner is very friendly and she remembers her customers. This is a
            hidden gem I highly recommend! There is parking in the plaza. :)

            Finding good food is like falling in love; you get hit when you
            least expect it. This was my experience at this place. I was super
            hungry off my flight, and it happened to be walking distance from
            the Airbnb. I was blown away by the food. All I had was the beef
            rice bowl but it came with a smorgasbord of other tasty sides. The
            beef alone was worth writing this review, but the whole ensemble
            stole my heart. Easily a top 10 meal of my life. If you’re in the
            area how do you not eat here? If I lived in Toronto or within an
            hour drive of this place I’d probably go at least twice a month if
            not once a week. I’m probably gonna go back tomorrow.

            a year ago I ordered a large order for my office of 30 people and it
            was perfect for our holiday lunch! The lunch boxes came with so many
            delicious side dishes, and not too much rice, which was wonderful.
            Very affordable price as well. Will definitely order from them
            again. Thank you so much for making such delicious lunches.
